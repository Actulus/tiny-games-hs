## Play

Get ready to ski! Avoid the ðŸŒ² trees! ðŸŒ² `,` moves left, `.` moves right.
How long can you last ?

Best played in a white background terminal.
Uses emojis, may not look right or run well with all fonts/machines.
In particular, is unplayable in some terminals on mac (iTerm, Terminal -
use VS Code terminal instead - please chat me if you know more about this).

## About

This is a classic - one of the simplest ways to build an fast action game,
one that could always be expected to run reasonably well since one thing
every machine can do well is scroll text upwards..

But **alas**. Not in these end times of 2023.. this game as written (with the tree emoji)
brings the standard terminals on a macbook m1 to their knees. ðŸ˜­
